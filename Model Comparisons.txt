Evaluating the performance of each model
Using the testing data to evaluate each model and compare the performance:

CONCLUSIONS
----------------------------
Which model has a lower loss?
Answer:The LSTM Stock Predictor Closing model has the lower loss which was determined from running windows 1-10.
----------------------------
Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
Answer:The LSTM Stock Predictor Closing model tracks the actual values better over time.
----------------------------
Which window size works best for the model?
Answer:The window size that works better is 3.
